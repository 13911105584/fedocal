- Unit-tests, unit-tests and more unit-tests
- Fix current unit-tests

- Add documentation on how to install/deploy it
- Add setup.py
- Add license
- Complete the code documentation

- Add user timezone in a new column on the calendar view


- Long term: see if we ever can provide a caldav output for the calendars
   (it would be read only, but that would be pretty cool to have)
